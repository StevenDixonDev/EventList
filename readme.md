# Eventlist

Eventlist is a ? for and event system for games or other event based apps.

This is my attempt to code a management system for these items.

## Core Idea

Start with a Linked list style object

give the user the ability to add items to the list 

let complexity evolve into the system in the form of features.

## Ideas

Implement socket io into the mix? or make it easy for a user to do so
